/*
 Backspace String Compare

 Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

 Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

//Time Complexity: O(m + n) - where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t, respectively.
//Space Complexity: O(m + n) - space is used to store processed strings.
